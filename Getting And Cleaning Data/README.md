# Project: Getting and cleaning data

## Project Background

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:
 * ability to collect data
 * work with data
 * clean a data set. 

The goal is 
 * to prepare tidy data for later analysis. 
 

###Data Source
  Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
  Following data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
  A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

 ### Steps to Tidy Data
 * Download files into local environment e.g. working directory on your laptop
 * Open the R script "run_analysis.R" using a TEXT Editor
 * Change the parameter of "setwd()" function call to the working directory/folder where R script file is saved/download
 * Open an R Console and change directory to working directory
 * Type "source("run_analysis.R") on R console command prompt and enter ( > source("run_analysis.R")
 * Type "run_analysis()" at R console command prompt and enter (> run_alaysis()

 ### Outputs Produced
 Following are the output files produced from above steps
 * Tidy Dataset tab delimited file: "HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphones_TD.txt"
 * CodeBook  file: "codebook.md"
